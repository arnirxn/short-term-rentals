# Short-term-rentals - Superhost analysis
This repo contains an analysis of short-term rentals focusing on the differences between Superhosts and regular hosts. The dataset used for the analysis is from Inside Airbnb for the city of Amsterdam.


### Main analysis
The analysis of differences between Superhosts and regular hosts can be executed cell by cell in the host_analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. 

### Visualisations
To generate png and html visualisation of the relevant metrics comparing Superhosts and regular hosts, run generate_visualisations.py.

### Helper functions
Most of the complexity is hidden away in helper functions. To better understand the code "under the hood", check out analyses.py, transformations.py and visualisations.py in helpers directory.
